# My Video List
This is my own curated list of the videos that I find useful in any way, grouped by the topic. The idea here is to create a "reading" list, just for the videos.

## Business & Technology
- [x] [**The electricity metaphor for the web's future**](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_on_the_next_web_innovation) by [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) ★★★★★

  Fascinating talk. Comparing the Internet boom to the early electricity industry. Very optimistic as long as you believe in this   comparison! 

## Physics
- [x] [**Boltzmann and the Arrow of Time: A Recent Perspective**](http://www.cornell.edu/video/leonard-susskind-1-boltzmann-and-the-arrow-of-time) by [Leonard Susskind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind)

  One of the best explanation of the concept of entropy. Very clear on universe dynamics. 

- [x] [**Black Holes, the Conservation of Information, and the Holographic Principle**](http://www.cornell.edu/video/leonard-susskind-2-black-holes-conservation-of-information-holographic-principle) by [Leonard Susskind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind) ★★★★★     

  How much does the Black Hole grow when you throw 1 bit of information at it? Great stuff and very easy to follow.  

- [ ] [**Entanglement: The Hooks that Hold Space Together**](http://www.cornell.edu/video/leonard-susskind-3-entanglement) by [Leonard Susskind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind)
